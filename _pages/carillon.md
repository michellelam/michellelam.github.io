Michelle S. Lam is an Associate Carillonneur at the Netherlands Carillon in Arlington National Cemetery. 

Dr. Lam is a seasoned performer who passed the [GCNA Carillonneur Exam](https://www.gcna.org/exam-carillonneur) in 2022. She was the resident carillonist at [Grosse Pointe Memorial Church](https://gpmchurch.org/) in Grosse Pointe Farms, MI from 2019-2023, and played weekly recitals at the [University of Michigan Baird and Lurie carillons](https://smtd.umich.edu/departments/organ/carillons/). She is also an alumna of the [Wellesley College Guild of Carillonneurs](https://www.wellesley.edu/music/performanceprogram/ensembles/carillon), and thus she is familiar with programming creatively for smaller instruments. 

Her recitals and work in the carillon community focus on highlighting people of color, women, and lesser played works. Selected programs for past recitals may be found here at [this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yBbaaqsHExDU1md3aXO9Nh0Cq2Sysf_wvTN4HS9HIag/edit?usp=sharing). Some recordings are available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9rENzxh-Bm7Jh1IHHb4N5-jUKiyFOsxD) and [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/michelleslam). With her wide-ranging repertoire, Dr. Lam is available for concerts and special events (sacred observances, wedding, celebrations) throughout the year.
