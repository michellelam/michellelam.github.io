About
======

I am a Senior Economist at Bates White Economics Consulting in the Antitrust practice. I received my Economics PhD (trade, labor) from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in 2023. 

Outside of Bates White, I am involved in the carillon community as a performer and volunteer, based at the Netherlands Carillon in Arlington, VA.
