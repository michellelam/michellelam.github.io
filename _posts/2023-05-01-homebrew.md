I was using R for doing some work in GIS. This clashed with my recent migration from my old Intel MacBook to my new M1 Macbook because Homebrew installs differently on Intel versus M1. Here is the process I took to fix my issues. 

## Error in R 

`Error: ‘m’ is not a unit recognized by udunits or a user-defined unit`

## Error Installing Homebrew
